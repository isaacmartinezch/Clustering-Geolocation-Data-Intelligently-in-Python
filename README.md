# Clustering-Geolocation-Data-Intelligently-in-Python

Project Structure
The hands on project on Clustering Geolocation Data is divided into following tasks:

Task 1: An introduction to the problem, as well as basic exploratory data analysis and visualizations
Task 2: Visualizing geographical data in a more meaningful and interactive way
Task 3: Methods of evaluating the strength of a clustering algorithm
Task 4: Theory behind K-Means, and how to use it for our problem
Task 5: Introduction to density-based clustering approaches, and how to use DBSCAN
Task 6: Introduction to HDBSCAN, to alleviate constraints of classical DBSCAN
Task 7: A simple method to address outliers classified by density-based models
